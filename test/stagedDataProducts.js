    name: "Japanese Wave Pattern Bowl",
    price: 45,
    description: "This elegant bowl takes its inspiration from the stylized waves that decorate a 19th-century Japanese stencil in The Met collection, which is made of paper reinforced with silk. Such hand-cut stencil paper, known as katagami, was used to make patterns for resist-dyeing of kimonos and other textiles. While these stencils and the skilled craftsmen who created them produced exquisite results on fabric, the stencils can be considered works of art in their own right, often showing breathtaking intricacy.",

    name: "Lotus Pen",
    price: 35,
    description: "Our exquisite pen design features a detail from a Japanese painted handscroll (Kamakura period, 1185–1333) in the Museum's collection, which illustrates episodes taken from chapter 25, the \"Universal Gate\" chapter, of the Lotus Sutra. This popular text describes the manifold mercies of the compassionate bodhisattva Kannon, the most beloved bodhisattva in East Asia. Although the compositions and many motifs of this version reflect Chinese pictorial traditions, it is clear that the artist inventively incorporated native Japanese (yamato-e) elements.",

    name: "Utagawa Hiroshige: View of Mount Fuji from Otsuki no Hara Print",
    price: 50,
    description: "Utagawa Hiroshige (Japanese, 1797–1858), View of Mount Fuji from Otsuki no Hara, from the series \"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji,\" 1858. This digital reproduction shows Mount Fuji as seen from the Otsuki plain in the province of Kai. It is from a series of views of Mount Fuji created by Utagawa Hiroshige in the mid-nineteenth century. One of the great Japanese landscape artists, Hiroshige's images of his native Japan are celebrated throughout the world. He only began to produce what are now considered his masterpieces in the 1830s, when he was well into middle age, and became known for his pictures of birds and flowers and landscapes, especially scenic spots on the Tokaido road from Kyoto to Edo. Drawing on a wide range of influences, Hiroshige used various painting techniques to produce innovative woodblock print images and to add a sense of atmosphere and lyricism to his compositions.",
