      This site was inspired by my love of art history and a trip to Japan I took in late 2016. Itâ€™s written in Angular and utilizes Node.js and Express, as well as PostgreSQL for the database. It is my first full-stack app. Thanks goes to my DevMountain mentors Joe Blank, Stephen Brinkworth, and Matt French and my classmate Khayyam Jones for helping me complete it.
