    <h1>Sumi-e</h1>
    <p>Ink wash painting, known as sumi-e or suiboku in Japanese, came to the country from China approximately six hundred years ago. The works selected for this exhibit are outstanding 15th century examples of the technique. The artists included in the exhibit represent several generations of teachers and students: the originally Chinese Josetsu tutored Tensho Shubun, who in turn taught pupils Sesshu Toyo and Kano Masanobu. The master-student relationship between the artists means that this exhibit offers viewers a unique opportunity to witness not only the idiosyncracies of their individual interpretations, but also the development of the artform through time. All reflect a profound engagement with the natural world. Below we invite viewers to examine the works in the context of recent photographs from Japan's national parks and other sites. These vistas attest to the awesome challenge of representing the Japanese landscape, a constant source of inspiration for the artists.</p>
