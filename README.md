# SANE-seed
This site was conceived of as the online presence for a fictional museum exhibit, including a working shop. The tech on this includes PostgreSQL, Angular, Node, Stripe, and Auth0. I've also integrated a Google Map to show the location of the "museum".

I borrowed some of the framework of the project from this seed: https://github.com/DevSeedlings/SANE_Seed_Local_Auth
